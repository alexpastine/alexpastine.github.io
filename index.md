### (Retirement - My 2nd Act)
My former fine woodworking site is still up, [view it](https://alexpastine.com/). An [archived version](https://web.archive.org/web/20130609144726/https://alexpastine.com/) will forever remain on the Internet Archive's Wayback machine.

I'll be adding stuff from time to time as my futzing allows. 

For now there are many photos of Marin and my dog on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/655413).

Here's a picture of one of my kitchen projects.
